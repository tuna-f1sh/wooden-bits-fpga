# FPGA Binary Clock

In attempt to get started with FPGAs and Verilog, I decided to port [Wooden
Bits](https://github.com/tuna-f1sh/wooden-bits) to a Lattice IceStick.
Counters and flip-flops are the first thing one learns when staring with FPGA
design so the project lends itself naturally. I learnt things FPGAs are good at
and things best done on a microcontroller, so it has been a useful experience.
